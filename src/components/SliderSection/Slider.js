The car is equipped with 19â€³ Scuderia wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, carbon-framed seats, and Scuderia Ferrari fender shields. The car has spent time in Michigan, California, Ohio, and Pennsylvania and the selling dealer purchased it in 2022. Work performed in 2022 reportedly included fluid changes and replacing the battery, tires, and F1 pump, shift actuator, and accumulator. This 430 Scuderia has 4,900 miles and is now offered in Washington State by the selling dealer with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title."
